55.0,Compare ADVANC's cumulative net profit in 2020 with 2021.,"To compare ADVANC's cumulative net profit in 2020 with 2021, we need to calculate the cumulative net profit for each year.

The net profit can be calculated from the netProfitMarginAccum column. Since the net profit margin is given as a percentage, we need to multiply it with the total revenue to get the net profit.

Let's calculate the cumulative net profit for 2020:

Quarter 1: 15.69% of total revenue (not given in the data) = net profit
Quarter 2: 16.07% of total revenue = net profit
Quarter 3: 15.86% of total revenue = net profit
Quarter 4: 15.79% of total revenue = net profit

Cumulative net profit for 2020 = net profit (Q1) + net profit (Q2) + net profit (Q3) + net profit (Q4)

Similarly, let's calculate the cumulative net profit for 2021:

Quarter 1: 14.42% of total revenue = net profit
Quarter 2: 15.30% of total revenue = net profit
Quarter 3: 15.19% of total revenue = net profit
Quarter 4: 14.74% of total revenue = net profit

Cumulative net profit for 2021 = net profit (Q1) + net profit (Q2) + net profit (Q3) + net profit (Q4)

Unfortunately, the total revenue is not provided in the given data. Therefore, we cannot calculate the exact cumulative net profit for each year. However, we can compare the net profit margins, which give us an idea of the profitability of the company in each year.

The cumulative net profit margin for 2020 is around 15.79%, and for 2021, it is around 14.74%. This indicates that the company's profitability decreased in 2021 compared to 2020.","SELECT year, netProfitAccum FROM financial_statements WHERE symbol = 'ADVANC' AND year IN (2020, 2021);",36.136098,0.0029273,63.129823,99.268848,,,,,
