8,How did BTS's Total Asset Turnover affect profitability in 2019?,"To analyze how BTS's Total Asset Turnover affected profitability in 2019, we can calculate the Total Asset Turnover ratio using the provided financial statement data.

Total Asset Turnover = Total Revenue / Total Assets

Using the data, we can calculate the Total Asset Turnover ratio for each quarter of 2019:

Q1 2019: Total Asset Turnover = 10239267.95 / 144314854.70 ≈ 0.071
Q2 2019: Total Asset Turnover = 9268692.00 / 171736925.00 ≈ 0.054

To analyze the effect of Total Asset Turnover on profitability, we can examine the relationship between Total Asset Turnover and Net Profit Margin.

Net Profit Margin = Net Profit / Total Revenue

Using the data, we can calculate the Net Profit Margin for each quarter of 2019:

Q1 2019: Net Profit Margin = 627223.14 / 10239267.95 ≈ 0.061
Q2 2019: Net Profit Margin = 893860.00 / 9268692.00 ≈ 0.096
Q3 2019: Net Profit Margin = 1277524.10 / 11698187.00 ≈ 0.109
Q4 2019: Net Profit Margin = 2459602.00 / 11185516.00 ≈ 0.220

From the calculations, we can observe that the Total Asset Turnover ratio and Net Profit Margin have a positive relationship. As the Total Asset Turnover ratio increases, the Net Profit Margin also tends to increase. This suggests that BTS's ability to generate revenue from its assets has a positive impact on its profitability.

This may negatively impact the company's ability to meet its financial obligations, making it a riskier investment.
