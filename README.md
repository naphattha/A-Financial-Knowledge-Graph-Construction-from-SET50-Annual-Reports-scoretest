# A Financial Knowledge Graph Construction from SET50 Annual Reports

This project constructs a Financial Knowledge Graph (KG) from the annual reports of SET50 companies. It enables users to query financial data through a chatbot interface, facilitating complex financial analysis. The project compares the performance and efficiency of two database systems: Neo4j (graph-based) and MySQL (relational).

## Project Structure

- `llm-chatbot-python_mysql - ENG`: Chatbot using MySQL with English question support system  
- `llm-chatbot-python_mysql - THAI`: Chatbot using MySQL with Thai question support system  
- `llm-chatbot-python_neo4j - ENG`: Chatbot using Neo4j with English question support system  
- `llm-chatbot-python_neo4j - THAI`: Chatbot using Neo4j with Thai question support system  

Each directory contains code and assets to run an independent chatbot instance in the specified language and database type.
