A rising D/E ratio can have several implications for financial risk:

1. **Increased default risk**: With more debt, the company's ability to meet its debt obligations becomes more uncertain, increasing the likelihood of default.
2. **Higher interest expenses**: As debt levels rise, so do interest expenses, which can negatively impact profitability and cash flows.
3. **Reduced credit rating**: A rising D/E ratio can lead to a downgrade in the company's credit rating, making it more expensive to borrow in the future.
4. **Decreased financial flexibility**: High debt levels can limit the company's ability to respond to changes in the market or take advantage of new opportunities.
